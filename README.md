### ProductionSafe

A simple Chrome extension that allows developers to inject warning banners into their production sites. Often times staging and production sites
can be very similar. If a developer is not careful he/she might modify the wrong server -- it's happened before. ProductionSafe is a safe solution that
injects a giant red banner that's impossible to miss directly on the page. The banner can be easily dismissed by clicking it or disabling the banners within
the popup menu.
